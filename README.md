# ðŸ§  Twitter Sentiment Analysis with NLTK

This project is a **Sentiment Analysis classifier** built using **NLTK**, the Natural Language Toolkit for Python. It focuses on classifying tweets as either **Positive** or **Negative** by applying a complete NLP pipeline, from data cleaning to model training and testing.

## ðŸ§ª Pipeline Steps

1. **Data Import** â€“ Using NLTK's built-in Twitter dataset
2. **Tokenization** â€“ Splitting tweets into word-level tokens
3. **Text Cleaning** â€“ Removing URLs, mentions, special characters
4. **Lemmatization** â€“ Reducing words to their base form
5. **Stopword Removal** â€“ Eliminating common non-informative words
6. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Converting tokens into feature dictionaries
7. **Model Training** â€“ Naive Bayes classifier on labeled tweet sets
8. **Evaluation** â€“ Accuracy and top predictive features
9. **Prediction Demo** â€“ Real-time test on custom tweet input
